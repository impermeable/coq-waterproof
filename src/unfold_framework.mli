(**
In this module we keep two tables:
- [wp_unfold_map] a map from strings to global references, that is used to keep track of the
introduced notations, and the global reference they are associated with
- [wp_unfold_tbl] a table from global references to unfold actions, that can later be used
  by the unfold framework. The unfold actions can be of three types:
    - unfold the definition associated to the global reference
    - apply a bi-implication
    - rewrite an equality
*)


(** A type to represent the different unfold actions, and the data they need. *)
type unfold_action =
  | Unfold of GlobRef.t
  | Apply of EConstr.constr
  | Rewrite of EConstr.constr

(** A type that represents the datastructure that can be added
    to the unfold table. When it is added, it will be converted
    to an unfold action. *)
type unfold_entry =
  | Unfold_entry
  | Apply_entry of Constrexpr.constr_expr
  | Rewrite_entry of Constrexpr.constr_expr
