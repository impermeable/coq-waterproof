(** This module registers two new bullet behaviors available for use in
Waterproof. With

Set Bullet Behavior "Waterproof Strict Subproofs".

one basically gets the default bullet behavior, with slightly different
suggestion and error messages.

With

Set Bullet Behavior "Waterproof Relaxed Subproofs".

it doesn't matter which exact bullets one uses in a particular place: they
all function the same. *)
