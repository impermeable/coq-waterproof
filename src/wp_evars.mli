(**
  Checks whether a given evar is a blank (entered by the user with the
  `_` syntax) in the evar_map.
*)
val is_blank : Evd.evar_map -> Evar.t -> bool

(** 
  Refines the current goal with just a new named evar, the name of which is
  based on the input string. The use of this is to replace unnamed evars with
  named ones, so that the user can refer to them later.
*)
val refine_goal_with_evar : string -> unit Proofview.tactic

(**
  A tactic that resturns a list of all evars in a term (= Evd.econstr) that
  were introduced by the user as a blank and have not been resolved yet.
