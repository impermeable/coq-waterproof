  Waterprove

  This function is the main automatic solver of coq-waterproof.

  The databases used for the proof search are the one declared in the current imported dataset (see {! Hint_dataset.loaded_hint_dataset}).

  The forbidden patterns are defined in {! is_forbidden}.

  Arguments:
    - [depth] ([int]): max depth of the proof search
    - [shield] ([bool]): if set to [true], will stop the proof search if a forbidden pattern is found
    - [lems] ([Tactypes.delayed_open_constr list]): additional lemmas that are given to solve the proof
    - [database_type] ([Hint_dataset_declarations]): type of databases that will be use as hint databases

  Restricted Waterprove

  This function is similar to {! waterprove} but use {! wp_auto.rwp_auto} and {! wp_eauto.rwp_eauto} instead of {! wp_auto.wp_auto} and {! wp_eauto.wp_eauto}.

  Arguments:
    - [depth] ([int]): max depth of the proof search
    - [shield] ([bool]): if set to [true], will stop the proof search if a forbidden pattern is found
    - [lems] ([Tactypes.delayed_open_constr list]): additional lemmas that are given to solve the proof
    - [database_type] ([Hint_dataset_declarations]): type of databases that will be use as hint databases
    - [must_use] ([string list]): list of hints that have to be used during the automatic solving
    - [forbidden] ([string list]): list of hints that must not be used during the automatic solving
