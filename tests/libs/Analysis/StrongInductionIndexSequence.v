#[local] Parameter candy_seq : nat → Flavor.
Parameter infinitely_many_sweet : ∀ k : ℕ, ∃ m ≥ k, candy_seq(m) = sweet.

Open Scope subset_scope.

Goal
  (∃ n : (nat → nat), (is_index_sequence n) ∧ (∀ k ∈ ℕ, candy_seq (n k) = sweet)).
Proof.
Define the index sequence n inductively.
- We first define n_0.
  By (infinitely_many_sweet) it holds that
    (∃ m : ℕ, (m ≥ 0)%nat ∧ candy_seq(m) = sweet).
  Obtain such an m.
  Choose n_0 := m.
  + Indeed, (n_0 ∈ ℕ).
  + We conclude that (candy_seq(n_0) = sweet).
- Take k ∈ ℕ and assume n_0,...,n_k are defined.
  Assume that (∀ l ≤ k, candy_seq(n(l)) = sweet).
  Assume that (∀ l < k, (n(l) < n(l+1))%nat).
  By (infinitely_many_sweet) it holds that
    (∃ m : ℕ, (m ≥ (n k) + 1)%nat ∧ candy_seq(m) = sweet).
  Obtain such an m.
  Choose n_kplus1 := m.
  + Indeed, (n_kplus1 ∈ ℕ).
  + We need to show that (candy_seq(n_kplus1) = sweet ∧ n(k) < n_kplus1).
    We show both statements.
    * We conclude that (candy_seq(n_kplus1) = sweet).
    * We conclude that (n(k) < n_kplus1)%nat.
Qed.

(* Test 4: Test notation in wrapper *)
Goal
  (∃ n : (nat → nat), (is_index_sequence n) ∧ (∀ k ∈ ℕ, candy_seq (n k) = sweet)).
Proof.
Define the index sequence n inductively.
* let s := Message.to_string (Message.of_constr (Control.goal ())) in
  assert_string_equal s (String.concat "" ["(Add the following line to the proof:
 ";"
