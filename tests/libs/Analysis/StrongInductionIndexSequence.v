#[local] Parameter candy_seq : ℕ → Flavor.
Parameter infinitely_many_sweet : ∀ k : ℕ, ∃ m : ℕ, (m ≥ k)%nat ∧ candy_seq(m) = sweet.

Goal
  ∃ n : ℕ → ℕ, (is_index_seq n) ∧ (∀ k : ℕ, candy_seq (n k) = sweet).
Proof.
Define the index sequence n inductively.
- By (infinitely_many_sweet) it holds that
    (∃ m : ℕ, (m ≥ 0)%nat ∧ candy_seq(m) = sweet).
  Obtain such an m.
  Choose n_0 := m.
  We conclude that (candy_seq(n_0) = sweet).
- Take k : ℕ and assume n(0),...,n(k) are defined.
  Assume that (∀ l : ℕ, (l ≤ k)%nat ⇒ candy_seq(n(l)) = sweet).
  Assume that (∀ l : ℕ, (l < k)%nat ⇒ (n(l) < n(l+1))%nat).
  By (infinitely_many_sweet) it holds that 
    (∃ m : ℕ, (m ≥ (n k) + 1)%nat ∧ candy_seq(m) = sweet).
  Obtain such an m.
  Choose n_kplus1 := m.
  We show both statements.
  * We conclude that (candy_seq(n_kplus1) = sweet).
  * We conclude that (n(k) < n_kplus1)%nat.
