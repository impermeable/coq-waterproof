Lemma exercise_10_7_6 : 
  ∃ n : ℕ → ℕ, (is_index_seq n) ∧ (∀ k : ℕ, P (n k) = blue).
Proof.
Define the index sequence n inductively.
- By (infinitely_many_blues) it holds that
    (∃ m : ℕ, (m ≥ 0)%nat ∧ P(m) = blue).
  Obtain such an m.
  Choose n_0 := m.
  We conclude that (P(n_0) = blue).
- Take k : ℕ and assume n(0),...,n(k) are defined.
  Assume that (∀ l : ℕ, (l ≤ k)%nat ⇒ P(n(l)) = blue).
  Assume that (∀ l : ℕ, (l < k)%nat ⇒ (n(l) < n(l+1))%nat).
  By (infinitely_many_blues) it holds that 
    (∃ m : ℕ, (m ≥ (n k) + 1)%nat ∧ P(m) = blue).
  Obtain such an m.
  Choose n_kplus1 := m.
  We show both statements.
  * We conclude that (P(n_kplus1) = blue).
  * We conclude that (n(k) < n_kplus1)%nat.
