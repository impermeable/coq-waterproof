(** First test: test all syntax variants **)
Lemma one_is_one: 1 = 1.
Proof.
  We need to show (1 = 1).
  We need to show that (1 = 1).
  We need to show : (1 = 1).
  We need to show that : (1 = 1).
  To show (1 = 1).
  To show that (1 = 1).
  To show that : (1 = 1).
  To show : (1 = 1).
  reflexivity.
Qed.


(** Second test: function definitions are judgementally equal to the function name. 
    So they should be interchangeable. *)
Definition double := fun (x: nat) => 2*x.

Lemma with_function_definition: double 2 = 4.
Proof.
  We need to show (double 2 = 4).
  We need to show (2*2 = 4).
  trivial.
Qed.


(** Third test: this should raise an error, as the wrong goal is supplied. *)
Lemma two_is_two: 2 = 2.
Proof.
  Fail We need to show (0 = 2).
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(** Fourth test: We need to show should handle a boolean statement *)
Goal forall a b: bool, is_true (orb a b).
Proof.
  intros a b.
  We need to show (orb a b).
  We need to show (if a then true else b).
Abort.

(** Fifth test: Test wrong goal with boolean statement *)
Goal forall a b: bool, is_true (orb a b).
Proof.
  intros a b.
  Fail We need to show that (andb a b).
Abort.
