(** Test 0: This should be the expected behavior. *)
Goal (forall n : nat, n = n) -> True.
Proof.
intro H.
Use n := 3 in (H).
It holds that (3 = 3).
Abort.

(** Test 1: This should fail as the wrong variable name is chosen. *)
Goal (forall n : nat, n = n) -> True.
Proof.
intro H.
Fail Use m := (3) in (H).
Abort.

(** Test 2: This should fail because the wrong goal is specified. *)
Goal (forall n : nat, n = n) -> True.
Proof.
intro H.
Use n := (3) in (H).
Fail It holds that (True).
Abort.

(** Test 3: This should fail because first the wrapper needs to be resolved. *)
Goal (forall n : nat, n = n) -> True.
Proof.
intro H.
Use n := (3) in (H).
Fail exact I.
Abort.

(** It should be possible to use an outside lemma *)
Local Parameter F : nat -> nat.

Goal True.
Proof.
Fail It holds that (F 3 = 3).
Use n := (5) in (F_identity).
It holds that (F 5 = 5).
Abort.

  throw readable error message stating as much.  *)
Definition f : nat -> nat := fun (n : nat) => n.
Goal False.
Proof.
  Fail Use n := 5 in (f).
Abort.

(** Test 5: original universal quantifier hypohtesis left unchanged. *)
Goal (forall n : nat, n = n) -> True.
Proof.
intro H.
Use n := 3 in (H).
ltac1:(rename H into HH).   (* test for hypohtesis without producing output *)
Abort.

(** Test 6: multiple variable specifications  *)
Goal (forall n m : nat, n = m) -> False.
Proof.
intro H.
Use n := 3, m := 4 in (H).
It holds that (3 = 4).
Abort.

(** Test 7: multiple variable specifications, different order  *)
Goal (forall n m : nat, n = m) -> False.
Proof.
intro H.
Use m := 4, n := 3 in (H).
Fail It holds that (4 = 3). (* as expected :) *)

(** Test 8 : use a placeholder as variable name *)
Goal (forall a b c : nat, a + b + c = 0) -> False.
Proof.
intro H.

Abort.

(** Test 9 : use named placeholder: then renaming shouldn't happen *)
Goal (forall a : nat, a = 0) -> False.
Proof.
intro H.
Use a := ?[b] in (H).
Fail It holds that (?a = 0).
Abort.

(** Test 10 : use named placeholder, continue with name of placeholder *)
Goal (forall a : nat, a = 0) -> False.
Proof.
intro H.

Proof.
intro H.

Proof.
intro H.
Use a := _ in (H).
It holds that (forall b : nat, ?a + b = 0) (i).
