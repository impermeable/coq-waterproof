Proof.
    We use induction on n.
    - Fail We first show the base case 2 = 2.
      We first show the base case 0 = 0.
      Fail We first show the base case 1 = 1.

(* Test 3 : Induction on a variable quantified by
  [∀ x ∈ nat, ...], rather than [∀ x : nat, ...] --
  Case where variable is not introduced yet *)

Goal ∀ n ∈ nat, n >= 0.
Proof.
We use induction on n.
* We first show the base case 0 >= 0.
  We conclude that 0 >= 0.
* We now show the induction step.
  Take n ∈ nat.
  Assume that n >= 0.
  We need to show that (n + 1 >= 0).
Abort.

  Case where variable is already introduced  with
  [Take ... ∈ ...] statement *)

Goal ∀ n ∈ nat, n >= 0.
Proof.
Take n ∈ nat.
induction n.
* change (0 >= 0).
  We conclude that (0 >= 0).
* change (S n >= 0).
Abort.
