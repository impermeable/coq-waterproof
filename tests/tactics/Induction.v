Goal forall n : nat, (n = n).
Proof.
    We use induction on n.
    - Fail We first show the base case (2 = 2).
      We first show the base case (0 = 0).
      Fail We first show the base case (1 = 1).

    - We now show the induction step.

(* Test 3 : Induction on a variable quantified by
  [∀ x ∈ nat, ...], rather than [∀ x : nat, ...] --
  Case where variable is not introduced yet *)

Goal ∀ n ∈ nat, n >= 0.
Proof.
We use induction on n.
* We first show the base case (0 >= 0).
  We conclude that (0 >= 0).
* We now show the induction step.
  Take n ∈ nat.
  Assume that (n >= 0).
  We need to show that (n + 1 >= 0).
Abort.

  [Take ... ∈ ...] statement *)

Goal ∀ n ∈ nat, n >= 0.
Proof.
Take n ∈ nat.
induction n.
* change (0 >= 0).
  We conclude that (0 >= 0).
* change (S n >= 0).
