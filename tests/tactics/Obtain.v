(** Test 0: works with existence statement*)
Goal (exists n : nat, n + 1 = n)%nat -> False.
Proof.
  intro H.
  Obtain such an n.
Abort.

(** Test 1: works with sigma type *)
Goal {n : nat | (n + 1 = n)%nat} -> False.
Proof.
  intro H.
  Obtain such an n.
Abort.

(** Test 2: Fails with other type. *)
Goal (exists n : nat, n + 1 = n)%nat -> (0 = 0) -> False.
Proof.
  intros H1 H2.
  Fail Obtain such an n.
Abort.

(** Test 3: Fails when variable name is already in use. *)
Goal forall m : nat, (exists n : nat, n + 1 = m)%nat -> False.
Proof.
  intros m H.
  Fail Obtain such an m.
Abort.

(** Test 4: existence statement is replaced by copy with the same label. *)
Goal (exists n : nat, n + 1 = n)%nat -> False.
Proof.
  intro i.
  Obtain such an n. (* check for yourself! *)
Abort.


(** Test 5: whether original hypothesis is destructed, so if the goal depends on the
      specific term of the sigma type, the goal changes as well.
      As one would expect when using 'destruct .. as [.. ..]'. *)
Goal forall p : {n : nat | (n + 1 = n)%nat}, (proj1_sig p = 0)%nat.
Proof.
  intro p.
  Obtain such an n.
  We need to show that (n = 0)%nat.

Abort.

(** Test 6: works with specifying statement.  *)
Goal (exists n : nat, n + 1 = n)%nat -> False.
Proof.
  intro i.
  Obtain n according to (i).
Abort.

(** Test 7: fails if specified statement does not exist.  *)
Goal (exists n : nat, n + 1 = n)%nat -> False.
Proof.
  intro i.
  Fail Obtain n according to (ii).
Abort.


(** Test 8: more advanced use of the [Obtain...such that...] in the context of limits of sequences *)
Local Open Scope R_scope.

    (quick fix for Waterproof editor / Coq lsp)  *)
Goal (exists n : nat, n + 1 = n)%nat -> False.
Proof.
  intro i.

Abort.

(** Test 11: obtain multiple variables *)
Goal (exists n m k l : nat, n + k + 1 = l + m)%nat -> True.
Proof.
  intro H.
  Obtain such n, m, m0, l.
Abort.

(** TODO: we should actually test for warnings below,
    once the branch on testing warnings and errors is merged. *)

(** Test 12 : obtain but with a wrong variable name *)

  in the string *)

Proof.
  intro H.

(** Test 15 : obtain when the variable has been visibly renamed *)
Goal (exists n : nat, n = 0)%nat -> True.
Proof.
  intro H.
  set (n := 3).

Proof.
  intro H.
  Obtain such n, m, k, l.
