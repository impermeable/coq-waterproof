  Check whether the provided variable name [candidate_name]
  corresponds to the name of the binder [b]

  Arguments:
  - [b : binder], the binder to check.
  - [candidate_name : ident], the candidate name for the binder
  - [guess_name : bool], whether to use a guess for the visually renamed binder,
    or to go with the exact binder name.

  Returns:
  - [ident option] - None if the binder name agrees, otherwise the expected/guessed binder name

to the product is changed to [id]

    name should be changed
