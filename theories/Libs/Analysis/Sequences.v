(** ** What is a sequence of real numbers?

A sequence of real numbers is a function from the natural numbers to the real numbers. So a function $a_seq : \mathbb{N} → \mathbb{R}$ is a sequence.*)

(** *** Examples of sequences

Let us give a few examples of sequences of real numbers. The first example is the sequence $a_seq : ℕ → ℝ$ defined by 

$$a_seq := \mathsf{fun} \   n \mapsto \mathsf{INR}(n) + 2.$$

In Waterproof, we can write this as*)

Definition a_seq : ℕ → ℝ := fun n ↦ INR(n) + 2.
(** We could also have written that $a_seq: \mathbb{N} → ℝ$ is defined by $(a_seq)_n := \mathsf{INR} (n) + 2$, and usually we just leave out the function $\mathsf{INR}$ and would write $(a_seq)_n := n + 2$.*)
(** 
Another example is the sequence $y_seq: ℕ → ℝ$ defined by $(y_seq)_n := 3$. The sequence $y_seq$ is just constant! Within Waterproof, we could define the sequence $y_seq$ by
```
Definition y_seq : ℕ → ℝ := 3.
```

However, let us also give an alternative way, which looks a  bit closer to the definition $y_seq_n := 3$.*)

Definition y_seq (n : ℕ) := 3.
(** ** Terminology about sequences

We call the function values $a(0)$, $a(1)$, $a(2)$, $\dots$ the **elements** of the sequence. Instead of $a(n)$, in mathematics we often write $a_n$. Moreover, instead of writing *let $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a sequence*, one often writes *let $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence*, or even shorter *let $(a_n)$ be a sequence*. 

The reason for the name *sequence* becomes clearer by writing the elements in a row, i.e. in a sequence,
$$
a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7, a_8, \dots
$$

However convenient and intuitive this notation is, it can also become confusing if you forget that a sequence of real numbers is *really* a function from the natural numbers to the real numbers.*)
(** ** Asymptotic behavior of sequences

Analysis all revolves around questions such as: what happens if a parameter gets very small? What happens if a parameter gets very large?

For sequences, the interesting question is: what can we say about the elements $a_n$ when $n$ gets very large? Think for instance about the sequence $a_n := 1/n$. Then we might want to say: when $n$ gets very large, the element $a_n$ is very close to zero.

The only thing is, that we need to make the previous sentence much more precise if we want to work with it in mathematics. For all $\epsilon : ℝ$, if $ε > 0$, then there is a certain threshold $N : ℕ$ such that for all $n: ℕ$, if $n \geq N$ then $a_n$ is within distance $\epsilon$ from $0$.`*)
(** The definition of [cv_to] is completely equivalent to the definition of [Un_cv] in the standard library. *)
Lemma convergence_equivalence : converges_to = Un_cv.
Proof.
    trivial.
Qed.

(** ## Preparation for a simple limit*)
Lemma archimed_mod :
  ∀ x : ℝ, ∃ n : ℕ, INR(n) > x.
Proof.
    Take x : ℝ.
    Either (x <= 0) or (0 < x).
    - Case (x <= 0).
      Choose n := 1%nat.
      We claim that (INR 1 > INR 0).
      { We need to show that ( 1 > 0 ).
        We conclude that (1 > 0).
      }
      It holds that (x <= INR 0).
      We conclude that (n > x).
    - Case (0 < x).
      By archimed it holds that (IZR( up x) > x ∧ IZR( up x ) - x ≤ 1).
      It holds that (IZR( up x ) > x).
      It holds that (0 < IZR( up x )).
      By lt_0_IZR it holds that (0 < up x)%Z.
      It holds that (0 <= up x)%Z.
      By IZN it holds that (∃ k : ℕ, up x = Z.of_nat k).
      Obtain such a k. It holds that (up x = Z.of_nat k) (ii).
      Choose n := k.
      We need to show that (INR k > x).
      By INR_IZR_INZ it holds that (INR k = IZR (Z.of_nat k)).
      (* TODO: better solution *)
      We claim that (IZR (up x) = IZR (Z.of_nat k)).
      { rewrite (ii). reflexivity. }
      We need to show that (x < k).
      We conclude that (& x < up x = Z.of_nat k = k).
Qed.


(** Next, we introduce eventually equal sequences, and show that they converge to the same limit.*)
Definition evt_eq_sequences (a b : ℕ → ℝ) := (∃ k : ℕ,
      ∀ n : ℕ, (n ≥ k)%nat ⇒ a n = b n).

Lemma conv_evt_eq_seq :
  ∀ (a b : ℕ → ℝ) (l : ℝ), (evt_eq_sequences a b) ⇒ (a ⟶ l) ⇒ (b ⟶ l).
Proof.
    Take a, b : (ℕ → ℝ) and l : ℝ.
    Assume that (evt_eq_sequences a b) (i) and (a ⟶ l).
    We need to show that (for all ε : ℝ, ε > 0 ⇨ there exists M : ℕ,
      for all n : ℕ, (n ≥ M)%nat ⇨ |b n - l| < ε ).
    Take ε : ℝ; such that (ε > 0).
    It holds that
      (there exists N : ℕ, for all n : ℕ, (n ≥ N)%nat ⇨ |a n - l| < ε).
    Obtain such an N1.
    By (i) it holds that 
      (there exists K : nat, for all n : ℕ, (n ≥ K)%nat ⇨ a n = b n).
    Obtain such a K.
    Choose M := (Nat.max N1 K).
    Take n : ℕ; such that (n ≥ M)%nat.
    It holds that (b n = a n).
    We conclude that (& |b n - l| = |a n - l| < ε).
Qed.

(** From this, it is fairly easy to prove that sequences that are exactly the same also converge to the same limit.
We do this by first using the lemma, and then proving that the sequences are indeed eventually equal.*)

Lemma eq_seq_conv_to_same_lim :
  ∀ (a : ℕ → ℝ) (b : ℕ → ℝ) (l : ℝ),
    (∀ n : ℕ, a n = b n) ⇒ a ⟶ l ⇒ b ⟶ l.
Proof.
  Take a, b : (ℕ → ℝ) and l : R.
  Assume that (for all n : ℕ, a n = b n).
  By conv_evt_eq_seq it suffices to show that (∃ k : ℕ, ∀ n : ℕ, (n ≥ k)%nat ⇒ a n = b n).
  Choose k := O.
  Take n : ℕ; such that (n ≥ k)%nat.
  We conclude that (a n = b n).
Qed.



(** ** A simple limit

The simplest sequence we can think of is the constant sequence, e.g. $1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...$.
We can generalise this to any real number $c$, and define the constant sequence $s_n = c, ∀ n : \mathbb{N}$.
Since we can choose $n$ as large as possible, without changing the value of $s_n$, this sequences clearly converges to its constant value $c$, i.e. $\lim_{n \to \infty} s_n = c$.*)
Definition constant_sequence (c : ℝ) := fun (n : ℕ) ↦ c.
Lemma lim_const_seq :
  ∀ (c : ℝ), constant_sequence c ⟶ c.
Proof.
    Take c : ℝ.
    Define s := (constant_sequence c).
    To show: (∀ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 ⇒ ∃ Nn : ℕ, ∀ n : ℕ, (n ≥ Nn)%nat ⇒ |(s n) - c| < ε).
    Take ε : ℝ; such that (ε > 0).
    Choose Nn := O.
    Take n : ℕ; such that (n ≥ Nn)%nat.
    It holds that (s n = c).
    We conclude that (& |s n - c| = | c - c | = |0| = 0 < ε).
Qed.

(** *** **Another simple limit**

Next, we consider another rather simple sequence, namely $1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, ...$.
We can denote the sequence as follows:
$$
  d_n = \frac{1}{n+1}.
$$
This is a bit more involved than the constant sequence, since the value of our sequence now depends on $n$.
Still, it is easy to see that when $n$ increases, the value of $d_n$ converges to $0$.*)
Definition d := fun (n : ℕ) ↦ 1 / (n + 1).

Lemma lim_d_0 : Un_cv d 0.
Proof.
    We need to show that (Un_cv (fun n => 1 / (n + 1)) 0).
    We need to show that (for all ε : ℝ, ε > 0 
      ⇨ there exists N : ℕ, for all n : ℕ, (n ≥ N)%nat 
      ⇨ ｜ 1 / (n + 1) - 0 ｜ < ε ).
    Take ε : ℝ; such that (ε > 0).
    By archimed_mod it holds that (there exists n : ℕ, n > / ε).
    Obtain such an n1. Choose N := n1.
    Take n : ℕ; such that (n ≥ n1)%nat.
    It suffices to show that (-ε < 1 / (n + 1) - 0 < ε).
    We show both (-ε < 1 / (n + 1) - 0) and (1 / (n + 1) - 0 < ε).
    - It holds that (0 < n + 1). (* n + 1 > 0 is difficult?*)
      We conclude that (& -ε < 0 < / (n + 1) = 1 / (n + 1) - 0).
    - We claim that (/ ε < n + 1). 
      { We conclude that (& / ε < n1 <= n <= n + 1). }
      We conclude that (& 1 / (n + 1) - 0 = / (n + 1) < / / ε = ε).
Qed.

Lemma min_1_over_n_plus_1_to_0 :
  Un_cv (fun (n : ℕ) ↦ - (1 / (INR(n) + 1))) 0.
Proof.
    By lim_d_0 it holds that (Un_cv d 0).
    By (CV_opp) it holds that (Un_cv (opp_seq d) (-0)) (i).
    It holds that ( Un_cv (fun n ↦ -d(n), -0)).
    It holds that ( Un_cv (fun n ↦ -(1 / (n + 1)), -0)).
    It holds that (0 = -0).
    It suffices to show that (Un_cv (fun n ↦ -(1 / (n + 1)), -0)).
    By (i) we conclude that (Un_cv (fun n ↦ -(1 / (n + 1)), -0)).
