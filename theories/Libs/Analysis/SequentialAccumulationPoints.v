Definition is_seq_acc_pt (a : ℕ → ℝ) (x : ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∃ n : ℕ → ℕ, is_index_seq n ∧ Un_cv (fun (k : ℕ) ↦ a(n k)) x.

Lemma seq_bdd_seq_acc_pts_bdd :
  ∀ a : ℕ → ℝ, has_ub a ⇒ bound (is_seq_acc_pt a).
Proof.
  Take a : (ℕ → ℝ).
  Assume that (has_ub a) (i).
  We need to show that
    (there exists m : ℝ, is_upper_bound (is_seq_acc_pt a) m).
  We need to show that (there exists m : ℝ,
    for all x : ℝ, is_seq_acc_pt a x ⇨ x ≤ m).
  By (i) it holds that (there exists M : R, is_upper_bound (EUn a) M).
  Obtain such an M. It holds that (is_upper_bound (EUn a) M).
  Choose m := M.
  Take x : ℝ.
  Assume that (is_seq_acc_pt a x).
  It holds that (there exists n : ℕ ⇨ ℕ,
    is_index_seq n ∧ Un_cv (fun k ↦ a(n(k)), x)).
  Obtain such an n. It holds that (is_index_seq n ∧ Un_cv (fun k ↦ a(n(k)), x)) (iv).
  Because (iv) both (is_index_seq n) and (Un_cv (fun k ↦ (a(n(k))), x)) hold.
  We need to show that (x ≤ M).
  By (upp_bd_seq_is_upp_bd_lim (fun k => a (n k))) it suffices to show that (for all k : nat, (a (n k) <= M)).
  We claim that (for all k : ℕ, (a k) ≤ M) (v).
  { It holds that (for all x0 : ℝ, EUn a x0 ⇨ x0 ≤ M).
    It holds that (for all x0 : ℝ,
      (there exists k : ℕ, x0 = a k) ⇨ x0 ≤ M).
    Take k : ℕ.
    It suffices to show that (there exists k0 : nat, a k = a k0).
    Choose k0 := k.
    We conclude that (a k0 = a k0).
  }
  Take k : ℕ.
  By (v) it holds that (a(n k) ≤ M).
  It follows that (a(n k) ≤ M).
