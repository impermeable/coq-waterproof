(** ## Creating a subsequence of elements satisfying a certain property

The purpose of this section is to provide a somewhat general strategy to construct subsequences of elements satisfying a certain property. *)
(** ### From existence of a next element to a function producing this element

The next lemma is quite technical, and is usually not so visible in classical analysis. We rely here on a version of the axiom of choice.*)
Lemma existence_next_el_to_fun :
    ∀ (a : ℕ → ℝ) (P : ℕ → ℝ → Prop),
    (∀ (m : ℕ) (N : ℕ), ∃ k : ℕ, (N ≤ k)%nat ∧ (P m (a k))) ⇒
      ∃ f : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ, ∀ (m : ℕ) (N : ℕ), (N ≤ f m N)%nat ∧ P m (a (f m N)).
Proof.
    Take a : (ℕ → ℝ). 
    Take P : (ℕ → ℝ → Prop).
    Assume that (for all m N : ℕ, there exists k : ℕ , (N ≤ k)%nat ∧ P m (a k)) (i).
    We claim that (∀ (m : ℕ),  ∃ g : ℕ → ℕ, ∀ N : ℕ, (N ≤ g N)%nat ∧ (P m (a (g N)))) (ii).
    {
        Take m : ℕ.
        apply choice with (R := fun (k : ℕ) (l : ℕ) ↦ ((k ≤ l)%nat ∧ P m (a l))).
        apply (i).
    }
    apply choice with (R := fun (m : ℕ) (h : ℕ → ℕ) ↦ ( ∀ N : ℕ, (N ≤ h N)%nat ∧ P m (a (h N)) ) ).
    apply (ii).
Qed.


(** The next definition captures what it means to be an index sequence.*)
Definition is_index_seq (n : ℕ → ℕ) :=
    ∀ k : ℕ, (n k < n (S k))%nat.
(** Given the function that produces 'good' elements, we can use it to construct a subsequence by induction.*)
Fixpoint create_seq 
  (f : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ) (l : ℕ) :=
  match l with
  | O => f O O
  | S k => f l (S (create_seq f k))
  end.



(** If the function that produces 'good' elements is such that the produced elements are far enough in the sequence, it is certain that the produced sequence is an index sequence.*)
Lemma created_seq_is_index_seq :
  ∀ (g : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ),
    (∀ (m N : ℕ), (g m N ≥ N)%nat ) ⇒
      is_index_seq (create_seq g).
Proof.
    Take g : (ℕ → ℕ → ℕ).
    Assume that (∀ (m N : ℕ), (g m N ≥ N)%nat) (i).
    We need to show that (for all k : ℕ, (create_seq g k < create_seq g (S k))%nat).
    Take k : ℕ.
    By (i) it holds that (g (S k) (S (create_seq g k)) ≥ S(create_seq g k))%nat.
    We conclude that (& create_seq g k < g (S k) (S (create_seq g k)) = create_seq g (S k))%nat.
Qed.


(** 
The next lemma records that indeed the elements in the subsequence satisfy the desired property.*)
Lemma subseq_sat_rel :
  ∀ (a : ℕ → ℝ) (g : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ) (P : ℕ → ℝ → Prop),
    (∀ m N : ℕ, P m (a (g m N)) ) ⇒ 
      ∀ k : ℕ, P k (a (create_seq g k)).
Proof.
    Take a : (ℕ → ℝ).
    Take g : (ℕ → ℕ → ℕ).
    Take P : (ℕ → ℝ → Prop).
    Assume that (∀ m N : ℕ, P m (a (g m N))) (i).
    induction k. (*TODO: if we use 'We use induction on k.'-tacftic, then we cannot directly match on k + 1 *)
    - We need to show that (P 0%nat (a (g 0%nat 0%nat))).
      By (i) we conclude that (P 0%nat (a (g 0%nat 0%nat))).
    - We need to show that (P (S k) (a (g (S k) (S (create_seq g k))))).
      By (i) we conclude that (P (S k) (a (g (S k) (S (create_seq g k))))).
Qed.



Lemma exists_good_subseq :
  ∀ (a : ℕ → ℝ) (P : ℕ → ℝ → Prop),
    (∀ (m : ℕ) (N₀ : ℕ), ∃ k : ℕ, (N₀ ≤ k)%nat ∧ (P m (a k))) ⇒
      ∃ n : ℕ → ℕ, is_index_seq n ∧ ∀ k : ℕ, P k (a (n k)).
Proof.
    Take a : (ℕ → ℝ).
    Take P : (ℕ → ℝ → Prop).
    Assume that (for all m N : ℕ, there exists k : ℕ , (N ≤ k)%nat ∧ P m (a k)).
    By existence_next_el_to_fun it holds that
      (∃ g : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ, ∀ (m : ℕ) (N : ℕ), (N ≤ g m N)%nat ∧ P m (a (g m N))).
    Obtain such a g. It holds that
      (∀ (m : ℕ) (N : ℕ), (N ≤ g m N)%nat ∧ P m (a (g m N))) (i).
    Choose n := (create_seq g).
    We show both statements.
    - We need to show that (is_index_seq n).
      We need to show that (is_index_seq (create_seq g)).
      By created_seq_is_index_seq it suffices to show that 
        (for all m M : ℕ, (g m M ≥ M)%nat).
      Take m, M : nat.
      By (i) it holds that ((M ≤ g m M)%nat ∧ P m (a (g m M))).
      We conclude that (g m M >= M)%nat.
    - We need to show that (for all k : ℕ, P k (a (n k))).
      We need to show that (for all k : ℕ, P k (a ((create_seq g) k))).
      Fail By subseq_sat_rel it suffices to show that
        (for all m M : ℕ, P m (a (g m M))). (*TODO: fix*)
      apply subseq_sat_rel.
      Take m : ℕ.
      We need to show that (for all M : ℕ, P(m, a (g(m, M)))).
      Take M : ℕ.
      By (i) it holds that ((M ≤ g m M)%nat ∧ P m (a (g m M))) (ii).
      Because (ii) both (M ≤ g m M)%nat and (P m (a (g m M))) hold.
      We conclude that (P m (a (g m M))).

Definition is_increasing (f : ℕ → ℕ) :=
  ∀ k : ℕ, (f k ≤ f (S k))%nat.
Lemma incr_loc_to_glob :
  ∀ g : ℕ → ℕ,
    is_increasing g
      ⇒ (∀ k l : ℕ, (k ≤ l)%nat ⇒ (g k ≤ g l)%nat).
Proof.
    Take g : (ℕ → ℕ).
    We need to show that ((for all k : ℕ, (g k ≤ g (S k))%nat) 
      ⇨ for all k l : ℕ, (k ≤ l)%nat ⇨ (g k ≤ g l)%nat).

    Assume that (k ≤ S l)%nat.
    destruct (lt_eq_lt_dec k (S l)) as [temp | k_gt_Sl].
    destruct temp as [k_lt_Sl | k_eq_Sl].
    (** We first consider the case that $k < S(l)$.*)
    It holds that (k ≤ l)%nat.
    By IH_l it holds that (g k ≤ g l)%nat.
    It holds that (g l ≤ g (S l))%nat.
    We conclude that (g k <= g (S l))%nat.
    (** We now consider the case $k = S(l)$. We need to show that $f(k) \leq f(S(l))$. *)
    We conclude that (& g k = g (S l) <= g (S l))%nat.
    (** Finally we consider the case $k > S(l)$. However, this case is in contradiction with $k \leq S(l)$. *)
    It holds that (¬(S l < k)%nat).

Proof.
    Take n : (ℕ → ℕ); such that (is_index_seq n).
    We need to show that (for all k : ℕ, (n(k) - k ≤ n(S(k)) - S(k))%nat).
    Take k : ℕ.
    It holds that (for all k0 : ℕ, (n k0 < n (S k0))%nat).

Lemma index_seq_grows :
  ∀ n : ℕ → ℕ, is_index_seq n ⇒ (∀ k l : ℕ, (k ≤ l)%nat ⇒ (n k - k ≤ n l - l)%nat).
Proof.
    Take n : (ℕ → ℕ); such that (is_index_seq n).
    Define g := (fun (k : ℕ) ↦ (n k - k)%nat).
    By index_seq_strictly_incr it holds that (is_increasing g).
    By incr_loc_to_glob it holds that (∀ k l : ℕ, (k ≤ l)%nat ⇒ (g k ≤ g l)%nat).
    Take k : ℕ and l : ℕ; such that(k ≤ l)%nat.
    We need to show that (g k <= g l)%nat.
    We conclude that (g k <= g l)%nat.
