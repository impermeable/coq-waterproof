(**
  Check if the type of the goal is syntactically equal to [t].

  Arguments:
    - [t: constr], any constr to be compared against the goal.

  Does:
    - Prints a confirmation that the goal equals the provided type.
    
  Raises fatal exceptions:
    - If the goal is not syntactically equal to [t].
*)

        | false => throw (of_string "Wrong goal specified.")
      end
  end.



(**
  Attempts to remove the [StateGoal.Wrapper] wrapper from the goal.
    
  Arguments:
    - [t : constr], type matching the wrapped goal.
    
  Does: 
    - Removes the wrapper if the argument matches the wrapped goal, i.e. the goal is of the form [StateGoal.Wrapper t].

  Raises fatal exceptions:
    - If the argument [t] does not match the wrapped goal.

      end
  end.

(**
  1) If the goal is wrapped in [State.Goal.Wrapper], attempt to remove it.
  
  2) Else, check if the type of the goal is convertible to [t], if so, it replaces the goal by t.

  Arguments:
    - [t: constr]
      1) type matching the wrapped goal.
      2) any constr to be compared against the goal.

  Does:
    - 1) Removes the wrapper if the argument matches the wrapped goal, i.e. the goal is of the form [StateGoal.Wrapper t].
    - 2) Prints a confirmation that the goal equals the provided type.
    
  Raises fatal exceptions:
    - 1) If the argument [t] does not match the wrapped goal.
    - 2) If the goal is not convertible to [t].

  Allow different syntax styles:
    - We need to show ...
    - We need to show that ...
    - We need to show : ...
    - We need to show that : ...
    - To show ...
    - To show that ...
    - To show : ...
    - To show that : ...

  Optional string keywords do need to have a name, even though the parser will not populate this name. 
  (That's why it reads "that(opt('that'))" instead of "opt('that')".
