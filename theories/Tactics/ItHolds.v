(**
  Attempts to assert a claim and proves it automatically using a specified lemma, 
  this lemma has to be used.

  Arguments:
    - [xtr_lemma: constr], reference to a lemma used to prove the claim (via [rwaterprove]).
    - [label: ident option], optional name for the claim. 
        If the proof succeeds, it will become a hypothesis (bearing [label] as name).
    - [claim: constr], the actual content of the claim to prove.

    Raises exception:
    - [AutomationFailure], if [rwaterprove] fails to prove the claim using the specified lemma.
    - [[label] is already used], if there is already another hypothesis with identifier [label].
