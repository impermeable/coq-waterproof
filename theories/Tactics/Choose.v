(** * Choose *)

(**
    
  Instantiate a variable in an [exists] [goal], according to a given [constr], and also renames the [constr].

  Arguments:
    - [s: ident], an [ident] for naming an idefined [constr]/variable.
    - [t: constr], the requirted [constr] that needs to be instantiated.

  Does:
    - instantiates the [constr] [t] under the name [s].

  Raises Exceptions:
    - [ChooseError], if the [goal] is not an [exists] [goal].

(**
  Instantiate a variable in an [exists] [goal], according to a given [constr], without renaming said [constr].

  Arguments:
    - [t: constr], the requirted [constr] that needs to be instantiated.

  Does:
    - instantiates the [constr] [t] under the same name.

  Raises Exceptions:
    - [ChooseError], if the [goal] is not an [exists] [goal].
