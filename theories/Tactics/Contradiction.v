  Starts a proof by contradiction.

(**
  Attempts to solve the goal by finding a contradiction to the previous statement.

  Arguments:
    - no arguments.

  Does:
    - If last hypothesis is of the form ~P, tries to find a proof of P and finish the
      proof with the resulting contradiction.
    - If last hypothesis is of the form P, tries to find a proof of ~P and finish the
      proof with the resulting contradiction.
    - Throws an error if no hypohteses, or if last hypothesis cannot be negated.
