  Attempts to recursively assume a list of hypotheses.

  Arguments:
    - [x : (constr * (ident option)) list)]: list of (hypothesis and optional hypothesis name).
  
  Does:
    - For the first pair of (hypothesis (and name)) in [x], assume the hypothesis (with specified name).

  Raises fatale xceptions:
