(**
  Specializes a hypothesis that starts with a for-all statement.

  Arguments:
    - [var_choice_list : (ident * constr) list], list of names for variables
        together with choices for those variables
    - [in_hyp : ident], name of the hypothesis to specialize.

  Raises fatal exceptions:
    - If the hypothesis [in_hyp] does not start with a for-all statement.
