  Attemtps to unfold definition(s) in a statement according to specified method.
  If succesful it also throws a fatal error suggesting the user to replace this
  command by an alternative, suitable tactic with the unfolded statement.
    E.g. if the statement corresponds with the proof goal,
  the user is suggested to use
    'We need to show that ([statement with unfolded definiton])'.

  Arguments:
    - [unfold method: constr -> constr], method to be used for unfolding
        unfolding is deemed to be succesful if [unfold_method statement] =\= [statement]
    - [def_name: string], optional string used for error message when unfolding
        is unsuccesful
    - [statement : constr], term in which definitions are to be unfolded.

  Raises fatal exceptions:
    - always if [throw_error = true], because it indicates that the user needs to
      remove this line from the proof script.
    - none if [throw_error = false].
