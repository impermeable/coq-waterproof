(**
This module provides a framework for unfolding definitions and alternative characterizations.

Please have a look at
the test file [tests/tactics/Unfold.v]

and at the bottom of the file
[Libs/Analysis/SupAndInf.v]

for the syntax for adding new definitions and alternative characterizations.

For using alternative characterizations, one can use

[Hint Resolve -> ... : wp_alt_chars.]
[Hint Resolve <- ... : wp_alt_chars.]

to add both directions of the equivalence to the proper automation database.

*)

(**
TODO / Note:

Some alternative characterizations will need to be added to a special
wp_alt_chars database, especially if they involve expressions that would
otherwise be shielded by the automation.
*)

(**
What follows are two methods to deal with alternative characterizations.
The second method uses rewriting and when combined with propositional extensionality,
can give significantly strong statmemnts than the first. Reasons why one might prefer
the first over the second:

- If one doesn't want to take too large steps
- If the automation cannot handle the rewriting used in the stronger tactic.
*)

(**
  Helper tactic that can be used as an unfold method in
  [unfold_in_all] below. This version can be used for simple reformulation
  of alternative characterizations. It will likely only work
  if the constant to unfold is the head constant.

  Arguments:
  - [alt_char : constr] An alternative characterization for the concept
    to unfold
  - [x : constr] The expression in which the concept should
    be unfolded
*)
Ltac2 apply_in_constr (alt_char : constr) (x : constr) : constr :=
  let h := Fresh.fresh (Fresh.Free.of_goal () ) @__wp__h in
  assert (False -> $x) as $h;
  let return_term : constr :=
    (Control.focus 1 1 (fun () =>
      let h1 := Fresh.fresh (Fresh.Free.of_goal () ) @__wp__h in

    ) in

(**
  Helper tactic that can be used as an unfold method in
  [unfold_in_all] below. When combined with propositional
  extensionality, this can give a slightly more advanced
  reformulation using an alternative characterization.
  It will likely work in more cases than [apply_in_constr].

  Arguments:
  - [equality : constr] An equality with which to rewrite the concept
  - [x : constr] The expression in which the concept should
    be unfolded

  end.

(**
  Attempts to unfold definition(s) in every statement according to specified method.
  If succesful it prints a list of suitable tactics
  that can be used to incorporate the unfolded statements into the user's proof script.
    E.g. if the defition was unfolded in the proof goal, the list will include
    'We need to show that ([statement with unfolded definiton])'.

  Arguments:
    - [unfold method: constr -> constr], method to be used for unfolding
        unfolding is deemed to be succesful if [unfold_method statement] =\= [statement]
    - [def_name: string], optional string used for error message when unfolding
        is unsuccesful
    - [throw_error : bool], whether the tactic should throw an error which suggests
        user to remove this tactic in final version of the proof.
    - [definitional : bool], whether the unfolded version is definitionally equal to the original (as opposed to an alternative characterization)

  Raises fatal exceptions:
    - [always/none] depending on value of [throw_error].
