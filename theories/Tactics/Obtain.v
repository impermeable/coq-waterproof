(** *
  Chooses a variable according to a particular hypothesis and labels the remaining parts of the definition.

  Arguments:
    - [s: ident], the name of the variable to be chosen.
    - [v: ident], the hypothesis used.
    - [pred_u: constr], predicate that should hold for [s] and [v]'s type should match (ex [pred_u]) or (sig [pred_u]).
    - [u: ident option], optional name of property that [s] is to satisfy.
  Does:
    - Destructs the constr [v] under the names [s] (and [u]).
    - Copies the hypothesis [v] to a new hypothesis also called [v], hence the hypothesis is preserved despite its destruction.

  Raises exceptions:
    - [ChooseSuchThatError], if [v]'s type does not match (ex [pred_u]) or (sig [pred_u]).
