(** * induction_without_hypothesis_naming
    Performs mathematical induction.

    Arguments:
        - [x: ident], the variable to perform the induction on.

    Does:
        - performs induction on [x].
        - If [x] is a natural number, the first goal is wrapped in 
          NaturalInduction.Base.Wrapper and the second goal is wrapped in
          NaturalInduction.Step.Wrapper.
        - Otherwise, the resulting cases are wrapped in the StateGoal.Wrapper.

    Raises Exceptions:
        - [NaturalInductionError], if the [goal] is the type [t] wrapped in the base case wrapper,
