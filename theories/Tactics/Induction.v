          NaturalInduction.Step.Wrapper.
        - Otherwise, the resulting cases are wrapped in the StateGoal.Wrapper.

(* Quick fix for Wateproof editor / Coq lsp, where
  [We use induction on

   Qed.]
  was interpreted [We use induction on Qed.].
  Although in Coq [Qed] is acceptable as variable name, it is confusing.
  Hence we throw an error in the form of a 'Syntax error'.

  TODO: can probably be fixed with binders...
